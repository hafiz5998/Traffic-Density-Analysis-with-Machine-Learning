# Traffic-Density-Analysis-with-Machine-Learning

This is a machine learning project. The main purpose of the project is automate the classification of traffic images using ML.

The initial concept is to implement deep learning architecture for the model creation. The model will have the ability to predict images into three main category 
(Low, Medium, and High Density). Therefore, a good ML model is required as predicting images based on traffic density is quite diificult.

DATASET: Traffic images collected from Malaysia Live Traffic Camera (Jalanow.com)

Unique Approach: For this project, to improve the accuracy of the ML model of Traffic image classification, a Hybrid technique is applied where 
Deep Learning architecture is used as the feature extractor and combine with traditional machine learning Classifier. 

Example: DeepLearning(CNN) + SVM

Attach in this repository is the code.
